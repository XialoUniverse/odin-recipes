        <ol>
            <li>Preparing the Vegetables:
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash the tomatoes, bell pepper, and green peppers.</li>
                    <li>Dice the tomatoes into small pieces.</li>
                    <li>Remove the seeds from the bell pepper and green peppers, then chop them into small cubes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Whisk the Eggs:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, crack the 3 eggs and whisk them together until well combined. You can season them with a pinch of salt and pepper at this stage for added flavor.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cook the Vegetables:
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add a small amount of cooking oil or butter to the pan to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped bell pepper and green pepper to the skillet. Sauté for about 2–3 minutes until they begin to soften.</li>
                    <li>Add the diced tomatoes to the skillet and cook for another 2 minutes until everything is heated through.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add the Eggs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pour the whisked eggs over the sautéed vegetables in the skillet. Allow it to sit for a few seconds until the edges begin to set.</li>
                    <li>Gently stir the mixture with a spatula, scraping the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan towards the center.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Scramble the Eggs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Continue stirring gently until the eggs are mostly cooked but still slightly runny. This should take about 3–4 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove the skillet from heat. The residual heat will finish cooking the eggs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You're Done! Serve the dish and add seasonings to your taste.</li>
        </ol>
